# Moo

A simple, reliable, and fast way to parse ES6 into the ESTree spec.

## How Moo Is Different

* It only parses the latest version of ECMAScript
* It only outputs [the ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree)
* It's written in C++ for speed and portability
* It's super new, so don't use it in production yet
